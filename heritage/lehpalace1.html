<h3 style="color:blue;"> INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>


Leh Place is also known as Lhachen Palkhar, at least that’s what the locals call it. This is a 17th-century royal palace and one of the best attractions of the union territory. This humongous and royal palace was built by Sengge Namgyal, king of Ladakh.

Currently, the palace is maintained and renovated by the Archeological Survey of India. It is divided into 2 sections, one of which is given to the current prince as their living area, and the rest is turned into a museum. There is a lot of amazing things that are housed inside the Palace.

<h3 style="color:blue;">HISTORY</h3>
<p>The amazing Leh Palace which is now turning into ruin was built in the 17th century by then king Sengge Namgyal. The design of the palace highly resembles that of Lhasa Potala Palace. The construction of this palace started in 1553 under the reign of Tsewang Namgyal. The palace was invaded multiple times and the royal family was forced to leave and take shelter in the Stok Palace.

This is a dun-colored 9-story palace that remains astonishing inside out. There is a prayer room, museum, and a beautiful view of the landscape in front of it. If you take a look from the rooftop, you will enjoy the sweeping view of the Zanskar Valley and Leh city.

<h3 style="color:blue;">SITE</h3>
<p>
The principal entry to the palace is located on its west side and also is composed of an elaborate wooden porch having three lions, agreeing to Sengge Namgyal’s name and heritage. The canopy and mounts are elaborately carved, still bearing traces of paint, and also their design appears to lie between the temple porch at Wanla and conventional seventeenth-century blossom style.

The lion at the middle may be transferred in and from its box-like market with the assistance of a mechanism inside the palace; dental traditions state that it opened its mouth and roared at undesirable traffic to show that the king’s energy.
